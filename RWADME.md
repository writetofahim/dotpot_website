        2. Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-built styles and components to easily create responsive and modern web designs.

        3. Context API: Context API is a feature of ReactJS that allows for the creation of a global state that can be accessed and modified by all components in a React application, making it easier to manage and pass data between components without the need for complex props drilling.

        4. Folder Structure: 
            - The src directory contains all the source code of the website.

## API:

    DotpotiT's API is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, utilizing JWT authentication and MongoDB for efficient and secure management of user data.

        1. NodeJS: NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side, providing an efficient and scalable event-driven, non-blocking I/O model and a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries.

        2. ExpressJS is a minimalist and flexible NodeJS web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building scalable web and mobile applications, with support for middleware, routing, templates, and more.

        3. JWT: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a popular method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, typically used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications, with a token containing a payload of user data that is signed with a secret key to prevent tampering.
