              A dedicated model is a hiring strategy where a company hires a team of professionals to work exclusively on its projects. The team is dedicated to the company and works under its management, but the company does not have to provide the team with physical office space, hardware, or other resources. The team can work remotely, and the company can monitor their progress through various communication channels.
